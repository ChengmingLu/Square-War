# Square-War
This is a extremely simplistic multiplayer RTS game without the implementation of multiplayer feature yet.
It is a top-down view game with two bases, only one being controlled by the player.
The base is mobile with poor maneuverability.
The base can produce two type of units: Hoosband and Wifoo.
Hoosband: combat unit, carries one round of projectile and need to return to base for resupply.
Wifoo: resource gathering unit, weaponless, collects resources and supply to base.

From the enemy's point of view, the player's Hoosbands and Wifoos have identical look, which hopefully would create new possibilities for RTS gameplay strategies.

There is an algorithm that allows Wifoos to collect resources automatically.

More to come...
